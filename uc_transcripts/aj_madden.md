[00:00:25] Aj, welcome to the Unmistakable Creative. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us. 

[00:00:29] **AJ Madden:** Srini, [00:00:30] honored to be here. I love your work. I respect and admire what you do. I appreciate the opportunity. 

[00:00:35] **Srini Rao:** Yeah you are in a long line of people that. Has been referred to us by our mutual friend and former podcast guest, Michael Schein, who is the best [00:00:45] guest referral source in the world.

[00:00:46] And no pressure at all. I'm expecting you to knock it outta the fart, given his track record. But all joking aside I wanna start by asking you, what did your parents do for work and how did that end up shaping what you have ended up doing with your life? And your [00:01:00] 

[00:01:00] **AJ Madden:** Thank you for asking that. My mother was a first grade teacher, and my father was a guidance counselor and wrestling coach.

[00:01:09] He, he coached other sports as well. And they're by far the two biggest influences [00:01:15] on my life. Their dedication to serving others is inspiring to this day. How selfless they are and how they put others first and serving others, their family, their community, friends, everyone. So [00:01:30] that is number one.

[00:01:31] Number two, their dedication to excellence at what they did. They showed up every day, gave their best effort. And we're just committed to excellence and going the extra mile and doing things [00:01:45] right and continuously learning and improving at what they did. So they had a major influence on my life and my career.

[00:01:54] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. Your parents, both being educators, couple of things come up for me. [00:02:00] What was the narrative that they passed on to you about making your way in the world? I also know that you have been an avid reader from a young age. If I remember correctly, you read presidential biographies, like all of them while you were in elementary school.

[00:02:14] **AJ Madden:** I [00:02:15] did earliest memories, maybe 11 or 12 years old reading as many pre presidential biographies as I could. I was just interested in anyone who had achieved greatness, great things. I was fascinated by the science of success and [00:02:30] why some people such as US presidents or billionaires or CEOs or Hall of Fame athletes.

[00:02:37] Could achieve so much in a lifetime. And what were they doing different than everyone else? So I started reading there [00:02:45] that, that type of book there. 

[00:02:47] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. That's unusually self-aware for somebody that young, what do you think it was that sparked that in you? Like how much of that was your parents? 

[00:02:57] And I always wonder [00:03:00] when you have parents who are educators, is it like people who have parents who are therapists? 'cause every time I talk to somebody who has parents who are a therapist, it's like, are you basically not as screwed up as most kids? They're like, no.

[00:03:09] Are you kidding? They're like, a lot of people say that was like the worst and best thing ever to happen to them. [00:03:15] 

[00:03:15] **AJ Madden:** Oh, that's interesting. Having parents as educate educators they're very committed to learning the importance of learning and reading and just continuing to make learning a lifelong [00:03:30] process and to never stop.

[00:03:32] And I think that was really important. In terms of what I being raised by educators. 

[00:03:41] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. One thing I [00:03:45] wonder because the funny thing about me, I realized that I actually didn't do a whole hell of a lot of reading after I finished undergrad. It was only after graduate school and starting down this path.

[00:03:53] And I'm pretty sure that I read more books in the time that I worked on unmistakable creative than I did in my entire [00:04:00] formal education. And I wonder what is it that happens to that thirst for learning with age? Why does it go away? And you have parents who are educators, so I'm gonna ask you the education question that I get to ask everybody who isn't educator.

[00:04:14] If you [00:04:15] given your background, the people that you've worked with and everything you have learned from these thousands of books and all the work that you've done, if you had to redesign this whole system from the ground up, what would you change about it based on your own experiences and based on what you've learned from your [00:04:30] parents?

[00:04:32] **AJ Madden:** I think you touched on one really important point earlier in terms of why people stop learning. Yeah I talk a lot about with clients, follow your energy, [00:04:45] go where your energy is, meaning what are you most interested in? Yeah. What do you love to learn about? What do you love to do? What do you love to work at?

[00:04:53] Follow that energy, which is a combination of what you are born to do. It's in your DNA every, I believe every man, woman, and [00:05:00] child has a natural ability or talent within them, a genius at something, greatness at something. And that's the that's what they're exceptional at. And then combined with what they love to work at and [00:05:15] learn about, which is separate 'cause you, because you could be good at something and born to do it, but not really love to learn about it and work at it.

[00:05:21] Or you can be great at you could love to learn about something and do it, but not be great at it. So my formula for that energy where you [00:05:30] should, what you should follow in life is what you're exceptional at, born to do and what you enjoy. Learning about and working at. So if we take that and apply that to education, trying to identify as quickly as possible [00:05:45] what someone has the most energy for, right?

[00:05:48] What brings them the most joy and fulfillment. And try to assist them in that direction and give them the best tools, the best education we can in that particular [00:06:00] area. 

[00:06:00] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. The thing is right now the system is so one size fits all that. I feel like there are a lot of people who basically, as a byproduct of the system, believe they don't have anything they are exceptional at.

[00:06:13] Simply because they've never been [00:06:15] put in an environment that brings that out of them.

[00:06:20] **AJ Madden:** That makes sense. And then it becomes then maybe they don't enjoy learning as much. In the process of schooling. And yeah, [00:06:30] when you love something, when you follow your energy, you can get lost in a book or lost in doing it for hours and hours seem like minutes. 

[00:06:37] So it's not it's not that grind that it can be for some people with schooling.

[00:06:43] And that even goes to higher [00:06:45] education as well. It goes beyond just K through 12. 

[00:06:50] **Srini Rao:** Okay. So I have to ask you, you specifically have said the word follow your energy and you didn't say follow your passion. Tell me more about that. [00:07:00] 

[00:07:00] **AJ Madden:** Sure. That energy it's e plus E equals energy.

[00:07:04] The first E is what do you exceptional? What do you what were you born to do? And then the second again, is what you enjoy working at and learning about. And to me, that is what [00:07:15] energizes you. So your energy is what brings you joy and what gives you energy. The more you do it, the more energized you get.

[00:07:23] Versus. Passion could maybe be interchangeable, maybe it's semantics. I really try to break it down [00:07:30] as close to exact as possible in terms of what to follow what brings you that joy? What juices you up? What gives you the juice, the energy. And it usually it pretty much always has to do with what you're naturally good at, so you become confident at it.

[00:07:44] [00:07:45] And also what you love to work at and learn about. Yeah. And then you just follow that. And that's my it's a big part of being successful and happy. I believe that's the big part of the formula of success and happiness. Yeah. Follow your energy. Charlie Munger said, follow your natural [00:08:00] drift.

[00:08:00] The billionaire Charlie Munger, one of the I think smartest people to ever live. He said, follow your natural drift. Go with the drift. It's like riding a bicycle downhill then versus with a grease chain versus riding a [00:08:15] rusty chain bicycle uphill. Just go with your natural drift, go with it.

[00:08:20] And you'll find success and happiness in pretty much anything when you find that thing, that one thing for you. Yeah. 

[00:08:27] **Srini Rao:** Tell me about the trajectory, like starting [00:08:30] with high school and the dad as a wrestling coach. What is it that has led you to where you are at today? What should been the different things that you've done?

[00:08:38] Because I'd imagine just like almost everybody I interview your path that wasn't particularly linear. 

[00:08:44] **AJ Madden:** [00:08:45] Sure. That earliest memory was, 12 years old where my energy went and it was studying greatness, reverse engineering success and simplifying it down. Whether it was a US president, a CEO, billionaire Hall of Fame [00:09:00] athlete anyone who's made a, a mark on the world. 

[00:09:04] And so that I did a lot of that weird kid, dunno where that came from. I think it just hits you. We all have something that just hits us. And that's what I did study that went [00:09:15] to Bloomsburg University and started studying business, but quickly realized that I didn't wanna learn what to think.

[00:09:22] I wanted to learn how to think. And I came to that conclusion after taking a philosophy class. Those professors [00:09:30] were teaching me not what to think, but how to think. 

[00:09:32] 

[00:09:33] **AJ Madden:** Which I put a lot of value on. So I switched to philosophy from business to learn how to think because I knew I, I had a strong feeling that I could go out and start a business or work in business and [00:09:45] study the greats to learn the business end of things.

[00:09:47] So really dove into philosophy after college. Really wanted to keep studying excellence and greatness business and leadership the best of all times. Started working in [00:10:00] nightlife bars, restaurants, particularly nightclubs. Worked as a bouncer and did that at night and spent 68 hours a day of studying.

[00:10:08] At that time, I had read that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who were the two wealthiest people in the world. Bill Gates didn't [00:10:15] take a vacation in 10 years building Microsoft and Warren Buffett studied six to eight hours a day. So I called it the Gates Buffett Plan, and I said, I'll study for 10 years without a vacation.

[00:10:25] I'm going all in on this. And and that was the goal. So I was a bouncer at night and I studied [00:10:30] during the day. And at that point I was working in a nightclub and I wrote a business plan for the ownership. And just on a whim, I thought there was an opportunity here. So I wrote them a plan [00:10:45] to dramatically improve the business.

[00:10:47] They read it. They hired me as general manager of the nightclub. Based on that plan, I was just a bouncer. So I went from bouncer to general manager and had some success there. We got some national attention [00:11:00] for the nightclub, and we had about half a million guests at the time. That were through the doors of the club.

[00:11:06] So all walks of life, and a lot of them were business owners and business people. They started asking me for advice in all aspects of business, from sales, [00:11:15] marketing, customer service, hiring, culture, leadership product development. So I did it for free. I thought this is added value to the guests, and they say, never start a business unless someone's asking you to.

[00:11:27] So people were asking to pay me to do it. So I [00:11:30] left the nightclub business, became a coach and advisor, and essentially went from bouncer to advising billion dollar companies based on doing a lot of study and research and then putting it into practice. 

[00:11:41] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. Okay, so let's start with the [00:11:45] nightclub, because I feel like a nightclub is a laboratory for understanding social dynamics and human behavior. 

[00:11:53] What did that teach you about people power persuasion? In general, just [00:12:00] social skills. 'cause as a bouncer you are the gatekeeper of letting people in or out of this experience they want to have. 

[00:12:08] **AJ Madden:** What a great way to put it. Serena a laboratory. That's exactly how I felt.

[00:12:13] And I wrote about that [00:12:15] in a book, black Belt Business, about how it was a laboratory for a few things for me. One, it was a laboratory for business. Two, it was a laboratory for self-defense. I've been training in mixed martial arts and just to be able to defend myself and be a good security [00:12:30] professional.

[00:12:30] So it was a laboratory for self-defense. It was also a laboratory for human nature and human interaction. And it is a it's all those things at hyper speed. 

[00:12:40] **Speaker 4:** Because 

[00:12:41] **AJ Madden:** everything happens extremely fast and is packed into about 20 hours a [00:12:45] week tops in a nightclub. Okay. Tops. So imagine packing a full week into, I would even say is sometimes 10 hours a week of a lot of activity.

[00:12:55] So you get, you have to learn everything at hyper speed. So you're right [00:13:00] what's specifically what you think about in terms of human nature? 

[00:13:04] **Srini Rao:** It's funny because my mind is gonna go to the fact that I'm a single guy, and I'm like, okay, what when you're watching men and women interact in a nightclub, I'm like, okay, where are guys going?

[00:13:15] What do you see? Where do you see the differences? Granted I've read over and over in numerous books that like I think it was Tucker Max who was like, anybody who thinks that a dark environment in which you can barely see somebody as a great place to meet women is clearly [00:13:30] delusional.

[00:13:30] Not, and I'm paraphrasing Here you is. Think about it. If you look at it from an evolutionary standpoint, that's like the most dangerous situation she could put herself in. It's not where she's ideally gonna meet the love of her life. 

[00:13:42] **AJ Madden:** Well said. It's almost not even real. [00:13:45] It's very, yeah. Cinematic and movie like the nightclub. 

[00:13:48] Yeah. No, I don't think it is the best place. You can make great friends and meet people and build relationships, but in terms, yeah, a long-term relationship you're talking [00:14:00] about. Not the best just have fun, enjoy yourself and look for your soulmate maybe somewhere else.

[00:14:07] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. I think there's also another side of human nature this brings out, right? You've got people drinking and this loud, [00:14:15] intense environment, loud music. Like I'm sure you've probably seen the best and worst of human behavior. 

[00:14:21] **AJ Madden:** That's exactly right. What you learn when you're meeting and having hundreds of thousands of guests through your doors.

[00:14:29] Is that [00:14:30] a few things that I learned after many years that I take with me. One is that pretty much everyone is a good person, okay? Most, the vast majority of people are good people. They're doing their best. [00:14:45] They don't mean to hurt others. It's such a micro fraction of people that are out to harm others.

[00:14:51] So that it gives you could get disparage because you do see the worst of people with, when it comes to violence. So then [00:15:00] you also see the worst of humanity as well. So if you focus on the violence and the bad situations and the people who have bad intentions, you can get a real dark world view because you see it firsthand and you see the worst in people.

[00:15:14] But when you [00:15:15] compartmentalize it and you realize that no, 99.99% of people are good people doing their best. And it doesn't matter what walk of life it is, what country, what background people are good in general. [00:15:30] That was my experience. And there's, there will also be people in life serini that, that do that mean us harm.

[00:15:36] 

[00:15:36] **AJ Madden:** Okay. And we have to minimize our time with them and interactions. Avoid them, but don't let it darken our worldview because [00:15:45] overall people are good. 

[00:15:46] **Speaker 4:** Yeah.

[00:15:51] **Srini Rao:** Okay, so I think that you know where I wanna get to with this, and you heard my interview with Michael. You know that I have certain like opinions and criticisms of personal development, even [00:16:00] though my friend's like you run a podcast that effectively falls into that category.

[00:16:03] And you've written books that fall into a category and I don't disagree with that. That is absolutely true. But one of the things that I think was really important that you said, and I wanna spend the rest of our time on this as [00:16:15] it relates to performance, was what you said about philosophy, which was how to think and not what to think.

[00:16:22] And I think so often when people look at prescriptive advice, the biggest thing that happens is first off [00:16:30] context is left out of all the advice in those books. And people don't actually have the awareness to think, wait a minute, I need to think about this in the context of my own life. You've basically got this like library of wisdom in [00:16:45] your head of presidential biographies.

[00:16:48] What made billionaires. Billionaires, you've worked with people. So let's dissect the, let's start with this. How to think versus what to think piece and like why is it that one, [00:17:00] people don't think about context when they're looking at things like this? 

[00:17:06] **AJ Madden:** I think people definitely can, you always just have to go one layer below the surface.

[00:17:10] Just one layer deeper. 

[00:17:12] **Speaker 4:** Yeah. 

[00:17:13] **AJ Madden:** And just [00:17:15] question everything. I tell clients, you don't ever have to listen to a word I say. I want you to think for yourself. I want you to consider it. You have to do what's best for you. There's more than one way up to the to the top of the mountain.

[00:17:28] That's one of my favorite principles. [00:17:30] Mental models. There's more than one way to the top of the mountain, so you have to try and see what works for you. And that's where, like you said, the context comes in. What your own personal background, your goals, your motivations, your life experience, your personality type, your [00:17:45] environment.

[00:17:45] So you need to have you, you need to be aware that there's more than one way to the top of the mountain. For everybody. I think that's really important. It shouldn't be. There's principles that, that are, there's solid principles in personal development, but [00:18:00] they're principles, they're not it's, again, it's not the only way.

[00:18:05] It's a way of thinking about things, but not a what or a how. 

[00:18:09] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. Let's dive deeper into this. How, tell me how [00:18:15] being a philosophy major influenced the way that you consume this kind of material and how you interpret it, and then how that takes into the application of it in real world scenarios with your clients.

[00:18:27] **AJ Madden:** Sure. Yeah. I think it's really important to never [00:18:30] underestimate how wrong you could be. Yeah. Okay. I think that's number one. That and Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger talked about this, that you should throw out one strongly held belief every year. 

[00:18:42] You should be Conti, Jeff Bezos talks about this as [00:18:45] well.

[00:18:45] A side of intelligence is the ability for someone to change their mind when better information comes along. I'm paraphrasing that, but philosophers were saying the same thing thousands of years ago. Yeah. Whether it's business philosophers or life [00:19:00] philosophers, spiritual philosophers you have to be able to change your mind when better information comes along.

[00:19:07] You have to be open-minded, be willing to learn. Listen and learn. And also at the same time, serini you [00:19:15] have to ignore unqualified opinions as well. 

[00:19:17] 

[00:19:17] **AJ Madden:** Right? You can't just take every piece of information and because your mind will be blowing in the wind. So you have to be scrutinous in terms of who you're listening to.

[00:19:29] Who you're [00:19:30] studying, who you're reading and then you stay open-minded there to learn as much as you can, but you have to identify who to really listen to and who not to, because there's so many minutes in the day, so many hours in the day. Time is [00:19:45] valuable. So you really, IIII challenge people to do what I say.

[00:19:48] I call, go to Mount Rushmore. You want to go to the Mount Rushmore of that, the information you're looking for. 

[00:19:54] **Speaker 4:** You 

[00:19:55] **AJ Madden:** wanna be successful in philosophy? Study the greatest philosophers of all time. Don't just [00:20:00] study the flavor of the week philosophy. You want to be a successful sports coach.

[00:20:04] Study the greatest coaches of all time. Go to the Mount Rushmore, go to those three to five people who are the best of all time and study them. Yeah, that's the biggest shortcut to success in [00:20:15] terms of philosophy and knowledge by far. Go to Mount Rushmore, Kobe Bryant called it going to Goat Mountain.

[00:20:21] Go to Greatest of All Time Mountain and study study them. He went to Michael Jordan and Akeem Elijah on, and Jerry West and all [00:20:30] these great experts. And then when he went into business after he passed away, he learned from Oprah Winfrey and Tim Cook and these other legends. So he would always go to Goat Mountain because he knew every minute counter and he wanted to go to the best source of information.

[00:20:43] Jeff Bezos [00:20:45] studied Sam Walton relentlessly and his biography. 

[00:20:48] That success leaves clues. So you want to quickly identify who's on that goat mountain of what you're trying to learn, and then open your mind again, because every minute counts ti time's valuable, and that's what the most [00:21:00] successful people realize that time is extremely valuable. 

[00:21:03] Yeah, that learning time is crucial because there's so much information out there in 2024. We can take in now books and podcasts and websites and all kinds of things, YouTube [00:21:15] videos. You have to be scrutinous with what you're taking in. And that's no disrespect to people who are not on that goat mountain yet.

[00:21:21] I just think they haven't gotten there yet. They could, I'm not gonna look down on my nose at them intellectually and say, you don't know you're not good enough. No, you could be on that someday. [00:21:30] It depends if you wanna put those 10, 20 years into your craft. Does that make sense? Yeah, 

[00:21:34] **Srini Rao:** it does. It, it also raises another question.

[00:21:37] Edit mentor Greg, the one I was mentioning to you, and one of the things that I think was really interesting about the way he [00:21:45] looked at a lot of this was it was balanced with almost harsh doses of reality. The ones that people don't want to like really admit to themselves. And he had this really interesting distinction of what is probable and what is [00:22:00] possible.

[00:22:00] And he said, look, he's do we need the possible? Yes, of course. He's it's the possible that inspires us to try things we've never tried before and to achieve things that we haven't. He said, without the possible, humanity wouldn't progress effectively. But he said, [00:22:15] but when you don't balance that with what is probable, you are lying to yourself.

[00:22:20] I'll give you an example. Like the example I always come back to is that no matter how much I practice, I'm never going to play in the NBA. I'm a scrawny six foot tall Indian [00:22:30] guy. It doesn't matter like genetics are not on my side when it comes to that cognitive pursuit, and you alluded to this earlier, like what is that thing that you are exceptional at?

[00:22:41] And I feel like so often people [00:22:45] get misled with these. You can do anything and be anything narrative. And again, that takes us back to context. It's wait, that ist entirely true. And yet people, I, he said he is like, this is what I think honestly is. When [00:23:00] people are basically pursuing Sian dreams, it's basically the cause of a lot of unnecessary suffering.

[00:23:07] And so often they don't even know why they're doing it or they're doing it because everybody around them is doing it. I remember when the podcast injury exploded and people were like saying [00:23:15] Everybody should start a podcast. And I think myself, that has to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

[00:23:19] Not because I don't think people should start podcasts because there's nothing that everybody should

[00:23:25] **AJ Madden:** Oh, that's a fantastic point. From both you and Greg, and I've heard you talk about this [00:23:30] before in terms of you, I, I believe it was you and Brad Stolberg in the interview Yeah. Talking about, quitting and when you should quit. And now people say you shouldn't quit and no, you should quit All kinds of things.

[00:23:44] You should quit. All [00:23:45] kinds of things that, that you're not making progress in. That they, where you're, that don't follow your energy, meaning what you're exceptional at and also what you enjoy learning about and practicing. That's where you should double down on your effort, triple down, go all in on your effort, [00:24:00] identify where that energy is, and then quit everything else.

[00:24:03] **Speaker 4:** Quit 

[00:24:04] **AJ Madden:** those things and really persevere because that's where you have the best chance of success in your career, in your work, and a hobby. All the above. And also your happiness and [00:24:15] fulfillment as well. Yeah. And you're right, it is dangerous advice, EV everybody could be do anything.

[00:24:20] And I think that can, that leads to, like you said, a lot of suffering for people because they go down a path where someone told them they should do this, and you can do anything. [00:24:30] You see it a lot in entrepreneurship. Oh, you should start that business. Yeah. You'd be great at that. 

[00:24:34] 

[00:24:34] **AJ Madden:** They have no idea.

[00:24:36] They have no idea if that person will be great at, that's why nine outta 10 businesses go outta business because it, that business is not led by their energy. What they're great [00:24:45] at and what they love to work at. 

[00:24:47] What they're exceptional at and what they're, they enjoy doing and learning about.

[00:24:51] And that's why a lot of businesses go out. Yeah. 'cause someone says, oh, you could do it. Anybody could start a business, be an entrepreneur. No. You have [00:25:00] probability, like you said earlier from Greg Hartle, you know what's possible versus what's probable. Yeah. And that's, again, go with your energy, go with what you enjoy doing, what you're exceptional at.

[00:25:12] **Srini Rao:** So you have this [00:25:15] roster of clients that are all sort of performers. You've mentioned advising billion dollar companies. You read all these books and the thing that's interesting to me is that all of us have access to an endless amount of information. To the point where I've joked that I could, if I were to, if I could actually [00:25:30] implement all the advice I've gotten from a thousand interviews, I'd be a billionaire with six pack abs and a hair of supermodels.

[00:25:35] Obviously I'm none of those things. And this is this age old question, and I've talked to Steven Koler about this. I've looked at so many people who study performance. [00:25:45] What is it what is the X factor here that distinguishes like the people who. Basically do all this work, read all this stuff try everything versus the people that you work with.

[00:25:57] Like what distinguishes the [00:26:00] people who are at the top of the game in terms of the way they think, the way they act, and also just the way that they spend their time and day-to-day. What is the distinguishing fact? What are, there's probably more than one, obviously, but what if you were to basically take [00:26:15] everything together, what are those things that create that X factor?

[00:26:19] **AJ Madden:** Sure. Th that's a great question. I know you've had some world class experts on this and Yeah. On the podcast, and after 20 plus years of research, about 20,000 hours plus [00:26:30] of spending time with the top 1% in the world, essentially I've narrowed it down to three habits. It's called the three Habits.

[00:26:38] It's the methodology I use and teach. And this is what this is what the best in the world do [00:26:45] different. It's three simple habits. The first habit. Is they master the most important serini. They identify what is the most important things they have to do on a daily basis, anywhere between one and three [00:27:00] most important things they have to do to be successful.

[00:27:04] Okay? And they are relentless at those one, two, or three things over a long period of time. The these three habits are also principles based. The 80 20 principle [00:27:15] now, and as also known as a Pareto principle, where very few things matter, but they matter enormously, so 20% of what you do can get you 80 to a hundred percent of your results, okay?

[00:27:26] And sometimes even less. It could be 10% of your activities lead to a hundred [00:27:30] percent of your results. So the best of the best in the world, they identify what those one, two, or three most important tasks are, and they get them done every day, just religiously relentlessly over a long period of time.

[00:27:42] The second habit of [00:27:45] our three habits is they make elevated choices. Okay, what I call elevated choices. And those choices fall under two categories. One is be kind and useful, and two is to do hard things. So I'll give you some examples of what I mean by doing [00:28:00] hard things that the best in the world do.

[00:28:02] They give their a hundred percent best, and what they do, they own it. Meaning they take responsibility for their shortcomings and setbacks and they get better because of it. They fearlessly ask for what they need. They address the elephant in the room, meaning they [00:28:15] have the difficult conversations no one wants to talk about.

[00:28:18] They tell the truth today, meaning they're direct and honest with others. They seek the hard truth. They seek that hard feedback from others, they run towards the fire, meaning they do challenging things physically and [00:28:30] mentally. They say no to almost everything. That's not getting 'em closer to their goals and priorities.

[00:28:35] They ask for help. Okay? And they also forgive forward, meaning many times they'll forgive and themselves and others. And [00:28:45] these are all elevated choices. So the best in the world, they're continuously making the elevated choice. Okay? The third thing they do, which we talked about earlier, is they model Mount Rushmore.

[00:28:56] 

[00:28:56] **AJ Madden:** They study the best of the best. Kobe Bryant [00:29:00] said that he went to Goat Mountain, Michael Jordan, Hakeem, Elijah Wine, Oprah Winfrey, Tim Cook. Charlie Munger, arguably one of the greatest business thinkers of all time. Read hundreds of biographies anywhere from Ben Franklin to the founders of [00:29:15] Costco.

[00:29:15] He went to Goat Mountain relentlessly in all types of different disciplines. Now I try to quantify this for people as much as possible in terms of, okay, so we have these three habits. How do you quantify this? And this is what I've seen over the years. [00:29:30] Outta these three habits we quantify these down.

[00:29:32] The first habit, spend 90 minutes to four hours a day working on your most important tasks. 90 minutes to four hours a day, sometimes more on your most important tasks. [00:29:45] And then the third habit in terms of modeling Mount Rushmore, spending at least 15 minutes minimum to an hour a day. And oftentimes more studying the best of the best.

[00:29:54] So if you want to find success at a high level, you've gotta make those elevated choices [00:30:00] daily. You've got to master the most important tasks, spending 90 minutes to four hours, and you've gotta spend 15 minutes to an hour studying the best of the best. Only go to Mount Rushmore. Now, Serini, if we combine that with [00:30:15] the energy you look at all these people who achieve so much, they all followed their energy without exception. What they were exceptional at and what they enjoyed learning and doing, right? So if you combine the three habits with [00:30:30] following their energy, that's where the magic happens. That's where very few people.

[00:30:36] Number one, find really, truly find their energy and follow it. And then second, really practice three, three habits at a high level. But the beauty is serini that [00:30:45] anyone can do it. We all have access to this. Anyone can do it. Anyone can seek out and really try to find their energy and practice these three habits so it's accessible to all of us.

[00:30:57] That's the beauty of it. That's why I love it so [00:31:00] much.

[00:31:02] **Srini Rao:** See, it's funny I'm thinking about the very first, which is like identifying that most important thing and spending like 90 minutes to four hours a day on it.

[00:31:10] Because for me, up until I finished writing books, that literally was a thousand words a day. [00:31:15] No questions. I was like, literally didn't matter rain or shine, drunk or sober, my only exception, wass surfing or sex. If those options were available, I would skip a thousand words and even afterwards I would just have the thousand word session.

[00:31:27] Granted it didn't work out with the one girl who I said I needed [00:31:30] to get outta my chair so I can write unless you're gonna take me back to bed. But the interesting thing, like one of the things I realized and even talking to Steven Koler and this whole idea of clear goals, sometimes identifying what that is as it relates [00:31:45] to a goal can be challenging because the goal is often like the lagging.

[00:31:49] Lagging indicator when Ryan Holiday wrote this post title, all success, it is a lagging indicator. And I thought, yeah, that is so true. Like everything that I've ever achieved is the results of the actions that [00:32:00] preceded it. And nobody sees that part. That's like when we see something in the public eye I had Alan Stein here was a coach for professional basketball players like Kevin Durant, and he coached Kevin Durant from the time he was like in high school.

[00:32:13] And he said [00:32:15] you don't see there's these unseen hours that get put in. And he said, and do not see any of that at all. He might have been the one who told me he went to meet Kobe Bryant. And I think he had also worked with Kobe Bryant and he thought he knew about Kobe Bryant's habits of getting there at 4:00 [00:32:30] AM And he thought, all right, cool.

[00:32:30] I'm gonna be there and show up. And he said by the time he pulled up his car and walked into the gym, Kobe was already on the floor shooting baskets. But I think that actually is sometimes very, 'cause the goal often feels nebulous, right? It's [00:32:45] okay, I have this absurd goal. It's like I want to hit, let's actually use a concrete example here.

[00:32:50] Let's say I want a million people listening to the podcast. And you also said a long period of time. I think that is a critically important aspect of this that we shouldn't leave out, [00:33:00] because that I think is even harder than the consistency. 

[00:33:06] **AJ Madden:** Okay. That interview with Alan Stein was outstanding, by the way.

[00:33:08] And he talks about Kobe that's a must listen for everyone. Alan's great at what he does [00:33:15] and I'm glad you pointed out that over a long period of time there as well. I tell I believe that you have to make a five or 10 year sprint. You've gotta make that five or 10 year sprint to be great at [00:33:30] something.

[00:33:30] And I call it the 10 year club. It's one thing. For 10 years, 1% better than yesterday. So it's one thing, narrow focus for 10 years, [00:33:45] 1% better than yesterday, meaning you're learning, you're growing, you're putting the effort in. You're not just repeating the same day for 10 years and you're not trying to get great at four different things.

[00:33:54] It's one thing 10 years 1% better than yesterday. Now, so how do people do it in five years? [00:34:00] How do they fold time? They, there's a few things that they do to do it in five years. One is they go to the best of the best coaches and mentors they can find. They truly go to Mount [00:34:15] Rushmore and they learn from them and they study the absolute best of the best.

[00:34:19] A second thing they do is they say no to pretty much everything else in their life. Okay. Sometimes health relationships [00:34:30] through unhappiness, maybe. They say no to pretty much everything else. They make the most elevated choices, meaning they're doing the most challenging things.

[00:34:42] They're pushing themselves outside their comfort [00:34:45] zone. They're serving at the highest level, and they are also, in terms of mindset, they're removing any limiting beliefs that they have that it's not possible. I think that's really important to remove any limiting beliefs that I a [00:35:00] limiting belief will be, I can't be great at this.

[00:35:01] I can't succeed at this. I can't do this now. I think they're ruthless on, removing the limiting beliefs that would hold them back mentally that this is impossible to be great at this, or I won't achieve this. [00:35:15] So you can do it in five years. You have to be relentless at saying, now truly go to Mount Rushmore.

[00:35:21] And you've gotta do difficult things the most. Yeah. But it does take consistency. But again. It's narrow focus. It's one [00:35:30] thing, 10 years, 1% better than yesterday. Because if you try to do too many things, and I learned this in business myself. As soon as I got laser focused on this coaching consulting practice, it skyrocketed where I was trying to do other things.

[00:35:43] I was [00:35:45] I had a hospitality company an acquisition group. The goal was to own some largest hospitality properties in the country. But as soon as I dropped that and just narrowly focused on this, I think that one thing's just crucial, again for five or 10 years. And you can have multiple, you can get into [00:36:00] multiple 10 year clubs.

[00:36:01] So you could go 10 years at one thing and then 10 years at something else. You saw it with Kobe. He was on his way to doing that. He was in the basketball club 10, 20 years. And then he was he would've been in the business club. As well. 

[00:36:14] **Srini Rao:** [00:36:15] Yeah. It makes me think of an experience like when Greg and I first started working together, one of the first things he had me do the time I was, he basically told me, let first thing, let's make a list of all the ways that you are currently making money.

[00:36:27] I was freelance writing for a website called [00:36:30] Search Engine Journal. I did some social media strategy consulting at and some people came to me for book marketing advice. He asked me a really simple question. He said, do you wanna do any of this in five years? And I was like, hell no. He said, then stop doing all of it right now.

[00:36:43] That's right. That was, [00:36:45] and the thing is, it meant foregoing all the income that was coming from that, which was crazy, but it was really insane to see, like in, I started work working with him in June, 2012 and by the, OR no, June, 2013. [00:37:00] By the end of that six months, I'd Pu Self-published two books, one of which became a Wall Street Journal of Bestseller.

[00:37:06] We had sold out a conference and we rebranded the show as unmistakable creative. That was all done in those six months. It was like nothing I had ever seen. [00:37:15] I just thinking about that makes me realize the other thing you said is the multiple tenure club thing, and I think about something Sam Altman has said is that whatever you do next should make whatever you did previously look like a footnote in your career.

[00:37:26] And I think that has been on my mind a lot with my 46th [00:37:30] birthday coming up. Wow, like what is that next thing gonna be that makes this look like a footnote in my career. 

[00:37:37] **AJ Madden:** Oh, that's interesting. Oh, what a great way to think about it. What can I ask you a question? Yeah. What [00:37:45] were the top two or three things you learned from Greg?

[00:37:49] You speak so highly of him and he just seems like a brilliant guy. 

[00:37:52] **Srini Rao:** Okay. I will tell you the number one thing because it's literally tattooed on my arm. And he had to drill this into my head over and over because [00:38:00] right after all that, everything went to shit, which I'll tell you about. Actually I don't wanna tell you my story.

[00:38:04] I wanna talk to you about how to recover from it because that's far more interesting. He had this phrase. That your temporary circumstances are not your permanent identity or your permanent [00:38:15] reality. And it was such a profound, yet, like simple and life changing idea. Where he summed it. He said it beautifully.

[00:38:26] He said the way you think about it is this, he he said, we [00:38:30] turned temporary things into permanent things. He said, you're not outta the money. You become poor. You're not experiencing health challenge. You become sick. You have a breakup. You're not heartbroken. You're un lovable. And he said, and you keep doing that until it prevents you from [00:38:45] doing the things you wanna do, having the things you wanna have, an experiencing the life that you are capable of experiencing.

[00:38:50] And I waited for years trying to I knew that someday that. That might be the tattoo. And I was like, I figured it out. I was in Brazil. I was like, wait, I can get the tattoo for [00:39:00] $60. And this was literally the morning I came home and Ganesh the Indian God, which i's funny enough, despite being raised Hindu, I had no idea about this until one of my own podcast guests said that Ganesh was a remover of obstacles.

[00:39:11] So I literally had a Ganesh and the phrase, your temporary [00:39:15] circumstances are not your permanent reality. TA tattooed on my arm. That was number one. The number two thing I think was that I realized that often the things you need to hear, [00:39:30] I sound things you want to hear sound good. And the things you need to hear are actually good, even if they hurt. 

[00:39:36] And to give you some context, like I went off the deep end when I had a breakup in 2014 and he, Greg didn't coddle me or gimme a motivational [00:39:45] speech. He's you're acting like a damn teenager. He was hard, he was really hard on me. I like, I hated him for it. 10 years later when I found myself on a Netflix reality TV show, that turned out to be invaluable advice because I [00:40:00] realized, I was like, I'm a public figure.

[00:40:01] Anything I say and do is scrutinized and amplified, and I need to act like a goddamn grownup. So more than anything, those two things was a lesson in maturity and managing your psychology, like realizing that you know [00:40:15] what shit's gonna happen and it's not necessarily things that I can control. And some of it's gonna suck and some of it's gonna be hard. 

[00:40:23] I think there's one thing people often don't realize is that you are gonna have to make impossible decisions when you get to a certain [00:40:30] level. Decisions that often will force you to choose between people who have been your friends and your own ability to succeed. And you often will choose the latter and it will come at the cost of your friendships and those bridges get burned.

[00:40:43] And not because you wanted them to, [00:40:45] but because it is just a harsh reality of achieving anything at a certain level. 

[00:40:50] **AJ Madden:** Wow, this that all three of those are gold. Any one of them individually could be life changing when you apply them. And a [00:41:00] lot of us can use all three at different 

[00:41:01] **Speaker 4:** times.

[00:41:05] Yeah. I 

[00:41:09] **Srini Rao:** wanna mention one other person who we have had here as a guest. And that was Justine Musk. You [00:41:15] mentioned the idea of saying no to everything. Sometimes their happiness, sometimes relationships, sometimes their own health. Justine had written this article that ended up going viral. 

[00:41:24] Some kid on chorus said, how do I become great? Like Steve Jobs, Richard Branson or Elon Musk. And Justine is [00:41:30] this incredible writer and nobody has had more of a front row seat to what it takes to become Elon Musk than Justine, his ex-wife. And so she wrote this really lengthy answer which ended up getting picked up by the New York Times.

[00:41:42] So I had her back when that article was [00:41:45] published, to talk about the psychology of visionaries. Of all the things that she said, there were two things that stayed with me that I still to this day. Remember verbatim when she described Elon, she said he has a need in a drive in him that is so that [00:42:00] it defines his life, that it defines his life.

[00:42:03] He has a way of seeing the world that, or taking the world that is in his head and imposing it on the world around him until it looks like the one that is in his head. But she said the part that you don't see is that what [00:42:15] you call extreme success. This is an extreme way to go about living and almost always it comes at the cost of everything else in your life.

[00:42:22] That's what you're willing to give up. She said I, what you don't see is the amount of work that goes into these kinds of accomplishments [00:42:30] because you don't we see them doing interviews, we see them in the covers of magazines. We see them on tab stages, but we actually aren't seeing what is happening every day.

[00:42:38] **AJ Madden:** Yeah, that's exactly right. It was, she wrote a great article a brilliant woman, and she really laid it out about as real as [00:42:45] it gets in terms of what it takes. And making that commitment. Yeah. That 10, 20 years sometimes sometimes it's a 20 year sprint for some achievers where you're saying no to essentially.

[00:42:57] Everything. [00:43:00] Everything that Elon Musk says. Everything I what does it take? Essentially saying no to everything else that other people hold dear in their life. And that's essentially what yeah. Him and Kobe Bryant with basketball. There's others in [00:43:15] different fields that you know, that, that are just all in all the time.

[00:43:18] And is that good or bad? I don't know. I can't get inside their head and their heart to know, do they feel fulfilled? Yeah. Is fulfillment a good life? By [00:43:30] some definition, yes. I think being fulfilled and doing hard things and pushing yourself and reaching your potential.

[00:43:37] I think fulfillment is separate from happiness or there could be even overlap there. But they [00:43:45] feel fulfilled because. They are going with their energy and they're giving their best effort towards it. So I don't judge people. That you just have to understand Yeah. Where the trade-offs are in terms of your health, relationships and sometimes happiness.

[00:43:57] 

[00:43:57] **Srini Rao:** [00:44:00] Yeah. So I had this note in my note taking up saying every decision you're making in life is a trade-off between freedom and security. And I realize how true that is no matter what we're talking about. Because to [00:44:15] your point I think the thing is we see all those iconic figures, but I don't think we often like one, we don't look below the surface because we model, we we like look up to these people and yet we don't realize maybe this is not for everybody.

[00:44:30] And that's okay. 

[00:44:31] **AJ Madden:** Yeah. Said. Yeah. Some of my favorite pieces of life advice, I, I collect principles and quotes and tens of thousands of quotes and great piece of advice and I catalog them and one of my top [00:44:45] three. You're talking about right here now is ask for advice from your 95-year-old self.

[00:44:53] And that was from a gentleman named Marshall Goldsmith, one of the greatest executive coaches in the world, advises Ford Motor Company and Best Buy in the [00:45:00] Mayo Clinic. And he said, ask for the advice. Sit down, close your eyes and ask imagine your 95-year-old self and ask for advice from them on what you should do, okay?

[00:45:14] How [00:45:15] you should live. And then he goes in to talk about the regrets of the dying people at the end of their life and how there was a study and they interviewed many people at the end of their life and they talked about their biggest [00:45:30] regrets. And one of them was don't wait to be happy.

[00:45:36] Okay? Be happy now. Don't wait until you get this or achieve this. Be happy Now. Number two is if you have a dream, go for it. Okay. Don't have [00:45:45] regrets when you get older. If you have a dream, go for it. Now. If you wanna learn a new language, go for it. If you wanna travel somewhere, go for it. If you wanna start go for a dream career or business go for it.

[00:45:55] If you have a dream, go for it. And the third piece of advice was surround your [00:46:00] spend the most time with your friends and family members that you're closest with. And I interpret this as surround yourself, spend the most time with the people who will be around you at your deathbed, and that you would be around them at their deathbed.

[00:46:12] That's my estimation. Three to 12 [00:46:15] people spend the most time with them. He says you have coworkers are great, have great relationships, but understand, spend the most time with the people that are most important. So those are the three pieces of life advice from people at the end their life.[00:46:30] 

[00:46:30] Now, Jeff Bezos has what he calls his regret, minimization framework, and that's how he'd made the decision to start Amazon. He asked himself, you know what? I'm older, 67, 80 years old. Will I regret not trying to start Amazon? And [00:46:45] he said, yes, I will. So he gave it a shot. He left a great career. He is a brilliant guy.

[00:46:49] He would've a lot of success in what he was doing, and he took a risk going from freedom and uncertainty to uncertainty. And I think that's a great [00:47:00] way to think about what we're doing right now through those type of frameworks. Particularly if you have a dream, go for it. And prioritize your friends and family know what's most important to you here.

[00:47:10] Don't have regrets when you're 95 that you didn't spend enough time with friends and family, if that's what's important to you, [00:47:15] or you had a dream and you didn't go for it, right? Or you didn't allow yourself to be happy because you put so much pressure on yourself that I'll be happy when I achieve this, or when I get this promotion, I make this much money.

[00:47:28] I get in this physical shape. I [00:47:30] have this type of relationship. I win this award. Don't wait to be ha to be happy till the end because tomorrow's not promised today. So that's one of my top three favorite piece of advice. Take the advice from your 95-year-old self ak regret minimization [00:47:45] framework. 

[00:47:48] **Speaker 4:** Yeah. When you say 

[00:47:50] **Srini Rao:** that, I think about the fact that there is one call that I will never miss, and if I do, I immediately call back. And that is my one-year-old nephew's call, like my sister calls every day. And that is the part [00:48:00] of my day that is, even if it's eight o'clock in the morning, I'm middle of reading, trying to get some work done.

[00:48:03] If I don't have anything that call, I always answer because I realize there's literally no more time that is precious than this. And like I'm just watching how quickly he's growing and I'm like, okay, I don't wanna miss [00:48:15] any of this. Because that time is so precious. One thing. So as it relates to this concept of elevated choices, let's talk about people recovering from setbacks.

[00:48:27] Because the truth is like we're all gonna have things [00:48:30] that go bad in our lives. Things shit's gonna hit the fan in every life. That is inevitable. Some people recover. And bounce back stronger, or they understand how to recover. What do you see in your claims in terms of the ones who handle this well and come out of the other [00:48:45] side?

[00:48:45] What are the things they do? And that's 

[00:48:46] **AJ Madden:** number of the, one of the top things that we absolutely work on because a lot of my clients are CEOs and business owners, and there, there's a lot of setbacks in business, there's mistakes, there's failures. So you have to be able to respond [00:49:00] properly.

[00:49:00] So we use a few different tools. One is from Dr. Matthew Resnick, I'm sorry, Robert Resnick. It's called e plus Article Z. I learned it from Jack Canfield who wrote, I think the greatest book of all time on success called the Success Principles. [00:49:15] So you have to understand that there's, it's e plus R equals OE is the event.

[00:49:20] R is your response, and O is the outcome. Okay? You can't change the event, but you can change your response. You have a choice of how you respond to it. [00:49:30] Once you realize that you have a choice to how you respond to events, everything changes, serini, everything changes. So that's a top tool. And really what I do is I share tools and mantras with clients that are Swiss Army knives.

[00:49:43] That'll be useful in all [00:49:45] kinds of situations. So e plus articles, o is one of my favorites. A tool called Relentless Solution focused by Dr. Jason sell. He also top three, he that's in my top three best books for performance of all time, where the relentless solution focused [00:50:00] tool is staying relentlessly focused on solutions going from problem to solution in 60 seconds or less.

[00:50:08] Okay, so you have a problem, you have a setback, you have adversity. Within 60 seconds, you start thinking about [00:50:15] solutions and what you can do. And he says, just think about one thing you can do if you just make one inch of progress that day. That's all that matters. Don't feel like you have to make a mile of progress.

[00:50:26] What's one thing I could do? So you take 60 seconds. You think, [00:50:30] okay, what's the solution here? And let's just focus on one thing. Those are two, two of my favorite tools overall. But ultimately, I think at a high level, just knowing that you have a choice and that reframing it in terms of [00:50:45] life doesn't happen.

[00:50:46] To me, it happens for me. Dr. Benjamin Hardy talks about that. Jack Canfield talks about the inverse paranoid, okay. He learned it from w Clement Stone, which is the inverse. Paranoid [00:51:00] is the world is out to help me. Okay? So everything that happens to me, it actually is helping me learn or grow and or improve or get or toughen up.

[00:51:08] So when you reframe adversity and setbacks, whether it's your health or your career, or a relationship, when you [00:51:15] reframe it, that the world is actually out to help me. It's teaching me something. It's toughening me up, it's strengthening me. That's a very powerful perspective. To have overall. And it's just, again, you make that perspective shift and everything changes.

[00:51:27] Now lastly, I'll give you one more tool [00:51:30] here. This is from Sigmund Freud. He talked about, in retrospect, your times of struggle will be the most beautiful, okay? In retrospect, your times of struggle will be the most beautiful. So you look back, Serena at the difficult [00:51:45] times as you're starting this podcast and you're building this great media empire here, and you're having to with all these great guests.

[00:51:52] But in the beginning, it was a struggle and it's tough because we don't know how it's going to turn out. But if we look at it, we'll look back on it. [00:52:00] And Dr. Stan Beram talks about this as well, that it's, you look back at every proud accomplishment in your life. Serena and any listener now can just pause and think about your proudest accomplishments, things you've accomplished in life, you.

[00:52:14] Look [00:52:15] back and your proudest accomplishments were the hardest. It's where you overcame the adversity, right? You found a way, as Kobe Bryant said, you figured it out. So you look back in retrospect now and say, those are the ones I'm most proud of. Now the magic is [00:52:30] think about something right now you're struggling with.

[00:52:32] Don't wait till down the road to look back at it and say, that was beautiful. Look at it as beautiful. Now don't wait till down the road. 

[00:52:42] **Speaker 4:** Yeah. 

[00:52:44] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. [00:52:45] It's funny, Freud clearly said it more eloquently than I did. So every year I do this like list of things I've learned for every year on my birthday.

[00:52:51] And so this year's 46 reflections and I'm just like, wow. So this thing is like potentially half over. I literally said [00:53:00] character building experiences usually suck in the moment, they suck when they happen. But you're right. But I think the other, the illusion here's the big illusion here is that people think, okay, you get to this level and then you're free of all these problems.

[00:53:14] [00:53:15] Like no, you are not going to be free of problems at any time in your life. There are always gonna be things you have to deal with, is what I have realized. They're just a different set of problems. And the magnitude is great because Sam Waltman actually had a really interesting way of saying this.

[00:53:29] He was, he [00:53:30] teaches, he made the Y Combinator startup curriculum available on podcast and very last lecture, he talks about managing your psychology. And the thing that I think was so striking to me about that, he said, people think it gets better. And he's but it actually gets worse. [00:53:45] He said, because now you have so much further to fall.

[00:53:49] And I was like, wow, that is crazy to think about that. But I think there's one other sort of subtle nuance here that I wanna make sure we get to, and that is people could [00:54:00] misinterpret this to think that, okay, this is just like a, like I go through the world with a Pollyannish view. The other thing I think I've seen with a lot of people is they're incredibly rationally optimistic.

[00:54:11] They don't, they're not delusively optimistic. One of my friends that [00:54:15] I like my best friends and I like, we're each other's yin and yang, and we joke that we need each other. 'cause I'm his reality check and he's my positivity check. Like my mind, I'm like, you anticipate worst case scenario so you can prevent them from happening and he doesn't anticipate them at all.

[00:54:29] Okay. [00:54:30] 

[00:54:30] **AJ Madden:** Oh, that's very interesting. And you two make a great dynamic duo and great partners here and friends because you have to have both. It's, but it has to be in a a certain ratio. Functional optimism. Yeah. Tony Horton talks about [00:54:45] this. To create a pre P 90 x brilliant guy you have to have functional optimism that no matter what, you'll find a way.

[00:54:51] Okay. That Dr. Susan Jeffers talks about, I can handle it. Okay? So you've gotta have that in terms of adversity. You've gotta say, you know [00:55:00] what? I'll find a way I can handle it. Now in terms of that's the positive end of things. Now, in terms of the other side of things, you have to think in what's called inversion.

[00:55:11] And in Charlie Munger made this famous tell me where I'm going to [00:55:15] die so I don't go there. So you have to know, you've gotta be aware of the pitfalls and the risks and what can do you harm and the mistakes. And I believe honestly, learning from your own mistakes is overrated. I think you have to do it because life is too [00:55:30] dynamic.

[00:55:30] I think smart people learn from their own mistakes and they make adjustments, but geniuses learn from the mistakes of others. Okay? They study success number one, the success of others. Biographies going to Mount Rushmore, getting the [00:55:45] best coaches and mentors they can find. They learn success and they also learn what not to do because that saves a heck of a lot of time.

[00:55:53] Charlie Monger talks about avoid the avoidable mistakes in life. You can think about in your health what's something I can avoid in terms of my [00:56:00] health? Eat healthy foods that's and avoid unhealthy foods. A lot of things are preventable in life.

[00:56:08] If you you think backwards, you invert, okay, what do I need to not do [00:56:15] Right? To get to where I don't want to be? And I think you can apply that to business relationships. Success is in the setup in most things in life. Set yourself up in terms of your career, where your energy goes.

[00:56:26] Find the right partner in life. Choose the right partner. [00:56:30] Yeah, Y yeah. You have to hit it from both sides though. You gotta know where you're gonna go to die, so you don't go there and avoid it. And you also have to know, be positive and optimistic and know exactly what to do, right?

[00:56:40] That's the magic that, those are the shortcuts. 

[00:56:44] **Srini Rao:** It's [00:56:45] funny because the metaphor for that I always think of is the check engine light on your car and how you take care of it. Like the second it comes on, the repair is a hundred dollars. I know this 'cause I've literally experienced this. You ignore it for a little while and that same repair turns into a thousand dollars.[00:57:00] 

[00:57:01] **AJ Madden:** Oh, great. Great example. Perfect analogy. The check engine light. And look for the check engine light in all areas of your life. Look for those and pay attention. Yeah, 

[00:57:10] **Srini Rao:** totally. I think that there's [00:57:15] one other final piece of this I want to finish up with. You alluded to Tony Horton. I know that you've written about it on a website mention you like alluded to earlier, is physical health, physical fitness.

[00:57:26] Because I feel like Eon is the one exception to this, but [00:57:30] when you think about the foundations of this, like I saw that you sleep nine hours a night. I remember reading Ariana Huffington's book where the sleep revolution, where she wrote about Andre Gal and how his shooting percentage.

[00:57:41] Increased like some astronaut, like enough of a [00:57:45] percentage where I was like, that's the difference between making the playoffs and not, and I think about my nephew, my sister. I was like, how you sleeping? She's so much that we have to wake him up in the now. I was like, good for him. That guy wakes up with a shit eating grin on his face every day.

[00:57:55] And she was like, you would too if you slept 11 hours a night. [00:58:00] 

[00:58:00] **AJ Madden:** That, that's a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Sleep is a big deal. The more we learn about sleep, the more we realize how important it is according to science. And I believe it's a real linchpin to all the other good habits. When you get good sleep, you have the energy to exercise.

[00:58:14] [00:58:15] When you get good sleep, you have the willpower to eat better. When you get good sleep, you're in a better mood. You have better relationships because of that. I think sleep is crucial in prioritizing it for what you need. Some people may need seven hours, some people may need eight, [00:58:30] some people need 10 hours.

[00:58:31] It's just knowing what you need and then setting your life up around that making it a priority so to speak. And that means saying no to certain things often. That means reading a book about sleep go find one or two of the [00:58:45] best books I've written on sleep and read those. 

[00:58:51] It's definitely important. It's a linchpin. Yeah. What about 

[00:58:55] **Srini Rao:** exercise? I it's funny 'cause this is the first time in my life I've actually gained weight [00:59:00] and like I'm having to work shed it. And the doctor was like, he, I'm an avid snowboarder, surfer, but he actually sat down and he was like, thousands of years of research on how to do this.

[00:59:09] He's just do it. And it turned out to be surprisingly simple without a bunch of fat diets. And he was like, [00:59:15] and he broke it down for me and I was like, wow, that's, that is, he is like 40 grams of fiber a day. Low cent, he said in 12 weeks and a half a con. And I I'm like, I don't measure the scale, I measure the number of one. 

[00:59:27] **AJ Madden:** Okay. [00:59:30] Yeah. In terms of movement specifically I love people to get full of their energy. What brings them joy in terms of exercise, because you're far more likely to do it if you enjoy it. There's so many different things people can do for [00:59:45] exercise. You can run, you could do a rowing machine, you could bike, you could swim, you could do yoga.

[00:59:51] I think resistance training is important for everybody to do in some form, but find a way to do it that you enjoy it. Again, go with your energy in terms of what you love to [01:00:00] do for movement, and also go with your energy with people who bring you joy, right? Who give you energy. So do exercise with people you enjoy.

[01:00:09] Exercise that you enjoy with people that you enjoy. Do it in a minimum effective [01:00:15] dosage. You don't have to exercise two hours a day to be healthy. Walking is the more we learn about walking the importance of steps, the more we realize that potentially is number one. So you don't have to run five miles a day, seven days a week to be healthy.[01:00:30] 

[01:00:30] Get a certain amount of steps in every day with people you enjoy walking with. I think people get overwhelmed and they feel like they have to do too much at once. Again, go with your energy, what you enjoy, do it with people you enjoy and also do it in a minimum [01:00:45] effective dosage way. Learn what that is and know that something is definitely better than nothing.

[01:00:50] Don't put that kind of pressure on yourself. Get accountability partners, which is huge. If you can get somebody to hold you accountable, whether it's your workout partner or someone to just check in with you on a [01:01:00] weekly basis, that can be huge. And then lastly, don't try to start six new habits at once.

[01:01:05] I work with cab. That's one of the biggest mistakes I see. And I learned all Dr. Jason s you arguably the greatest expert on performance in the world. [01:01:15] He talks about you just start one thing at a time. Don't try to do too much, because that's one of the biggest mistakes people make and goal achievement is they try to do too much.

[01:01:24] They set too many goals and they try to do too many things. So start one new habit at a time, get [01:01:30] it going for 30 days, and then add a second one. And if you can start two at once and get it done, that's good. But three might be pushing it. So don't push three new habits in a month. But again yeah, do it in a minimum effective dosage way for you and in a way that [01:01:45] also gets you excited.

[01:01:47] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. It's funny about up walking. So my dad is 72 and we are mistaken for brothers. And like people look at him like they look at him and they're like, why didn't your dad look so young? And it's so I'll tell you the funny [01:02:00] thing about him was like, what? It was his seventh birthday. My brother-in-law is yeah, asked me his secret.

[01:02:04] He was just like, he was like, don't mix life and stress from work and stress from home together, which was last, this surprisingly, like my dad just summed up a [01:02:15] thousand self-help books in three sentences. But actually the, and he, the man doesn't feel stressed. It's really bizarre. He doesn't show it.

[01:02:24] But one of the things that he does to this day, he's religious about it. He walks five [01:02:30] and all he does is walk. No intense exercise. He just walks five miles a day. And even when he worked at the University of California, like at Riverside, he would park his car as far away from the office as possible, which was about a mile walk.

[01:02:42] 

[01:02:42] **Srini Rao:** And [01:02:45] it's amazing, like just how that one thing has paid so many dividends, it's like such a simple thing. And I was, he is I listen to music and I just listen to the radio and I go for a walk every day. 

[01:02:57] **AJ Madden:** And that's it. That's a perfect example of just [01:03:00] one thing. It's exceptionally good for your mental health, for your physical health.

[01:03:05] It's something he enjoys doing. It's something that you can repeat daily, you can do it anywhere. He's a wise man and I love that he looks 30 years younger than he [01:03:15] does as well. I'll show you a picture after we're done. He'll be blown away. Oh 

[01:03:19] yeah. I'd love to see it. That's and when you talk about his stress as well, which is another crucial aspect of health, keeping your stress down.

[01:03:26] My, my dad, Al Madden is a an expert in this [01:03:30] and he's taught it for 40 years. Stress management, stress reduction, and calm and peace. And it's really a gift what he does for myself and so many others, thousands of others. And stress reduction is so important to all areas of our health.

[01:03:44] Our [01:03:45] physical health. If you look at studies from the Mayo Clinic, Harvard Medical School, Cleveland Clinic, 85, 90% of doctors visits are stress related. So anything you can possibly do to reduce your stress is excellent. Part of that is going, is exercising and [01:04:00] walking every day. Another part of that is having that relentless solution focus tool.

[01:04:04] The E plus R equals O tool. The world is out to help me. Tool life doesn't happen to me. It happens for me. Combining that physical activity with some good [01:04:15] mental tools to reduce your stress. One of Jason Silk's definitions of mental toughness is how stressed is someone, okay? Because again, it's your choice.

[01:04:25] You have an event that happens, but it's your choice how you respond to it. You could get stressed and frustrated and angry, [01:04:30] or you could do what I call going above the clouds. Okay? You gotta fly above the clouds. The clouds are is the frustration. It's the mess. Okay? You have to take your mind above the clouds and you have to go from frustrated to and these are the [01:04:45] three Fs that I share.

[01:04:46] Go from frustrated to forgiving. You've gotta forgive that person for whatever they did. No matter what it is. You gotta forgive 'em. Okay? Number two, you have to get fascinated, okay, why did this thing happen? Or what maybe what part did I play in this? So [01:05:00] you get fascinated. And number three, you take fast action.

[01:05:03] What's the one thing I could do instead of being frustrated, I'm gonna forgive and or get fascinated and, or. Take fast action on one thing and take your mind above the clouds. Alright. Go [01:05:15] from frustrated to to above the clouds, but again, I love that your dad's a walker. Such a great example.

[01:05:22] Minimum effective dosage. We don't have to run marathons walking every day. Now that Swiss army knife life [01:05:30] habit. 

[01:05:30] **Srini Rao:** I think the other thing you brought up I think was like exercise you enjoy. One of my friends was like snowboarding, surfing. I was like snowboarding. You ask any snowboarder and a surfer, none of them will tell you about exercise.

[01:05:41] The exercise is just a convenient fringe benefit. 

[01:05:44] **AJ Madden:** [01:05:45] That's interesting, isn't it? Yeah. That's interesting. To have a hobby that's hobby, that's good for your health, I think is one of the best things we can do for ourselves. A hobby that's great for our health as well. And your dad's hobby is walking five miles.

[01:06:00] I try to walk three miles a day myself at least. It's something I enjoy especially when you do it outdoors. So if your exercise, your hobby is one of your hobbies is health related. That, that's just a great way. Again instead of riding [01:06:15] a grease a rusty chained bike uphill, now you are riding that bike downhill in terms of exercise and health.

[01:06:24] By just finding something that you know, again, that you enjoy. 

[01:06:29] **Speaker 4:** [01:06:30] Yeah. I feel like 

[01:06:32] **Srini Rao:** I talk to you all day. I given the amount of knowledge that you dish. So in the interest of time, I will finish my final question. What do you think it's, that makes somebody something unmistakable? Yeah, 

[01:06:44] **AJ Madden:** I love this [01:06:45] question.

[01:06:46] It's a combination of three things. One is, we talked about it a few times already, the energy. Okay. Someone who is following their energy in terms of what they're exceptional at [01:07:00] and what they enjoy. Okay? Now combine that with a commitment to excellence. Everything they do, giving their best effort and going the extra mile.

[01:07:09] Okay. And then the 30 is to elevate others. Okay. This is my definition of a good life, a [01:07:15] happy, successful life. Again, follow that energy. Okay. Commit to excellence and to do your best and go the extra mile. And then the 30 is to elevate others through service. Be kind and useful to [01:07:30] me.

[01:07:30] Someone who lives that way is unmistakable and is also a gift to the world. 

[01:07:37] **Srini Rao:** Yeah. Amazing. I can't thank you enough for taking the time to join us and share your story, your wisdom, [01:07:45] and your insights with all the listeners. Where can people find out about you, your work and everything else?

But Coach AJ Madden, ha has all, any information for anyone who's looking to learn more about what I do and who I serve and how I serve them.
