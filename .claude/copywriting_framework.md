# Copywriting Framework

**Default:** Ramit Sethi IWT from `data/ramit_copywriting_framework_complete.md`

**Auto-apply:** IWT Scorecard (Message, Clarity, Emotion, Connection, Flow) + I,I,I Syndrome check + Serial Sentence Syndrome check

**Serial Sentence Syndrome:** Condense repetitive "They will X. They will Y. They will Z." into tight single sentences with commas/dashes. Use rhythm for emphasis, not filler.
