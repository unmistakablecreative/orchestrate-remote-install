# Archived Content Index

This directory contains archived content from the main CLAUDE.md to reduce context load. All knowledge is preserved, just organized into separate reference files.

## Archive Structure

### completed_projects_nov_2025.md
**Contains:** Completed work from November 2025
- Autonomous Execution System (Production Ready - Nov 3)
- Terminal Wizard for Self-Service GPT Onboarding (Nov 2)
- Docker Test Results (Nov 3)

**Why archived:** These are completed projects with all implementation details. No longer active work.

## Main CLAUDE.md Structure (After Optimization)

The main file now contains:
- Active work and current priorities

- Recent doc tracking

**Target Size:** <600 lines (down from 1080)
**Reduction:** ~45% smaller

**When adding new content:**
1. Add to main CLAUDE.md while work is active
2. Archive to appropriate file when project completes
3. Update this INDEX with new archive entries
